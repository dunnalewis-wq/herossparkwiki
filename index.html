    <h1>This is the begining of a wiki page for my game, A Hero's Spark</h1>
    <p>Please feel free to check around, look at the images and what they are. The game itself is still a massive work in progress but I truly love the idea of people being able to see the progress so far.</p>
    <h1>The forest of forgotten</h1>
    <img src="Assets/forest of death.webp" alt="A forest unkowingly dangerous">
    <p>The forrest of death is known to be the only part of land you can never return from. There is foretold to be a supernatural gateway through this land, yet no one has been able to reach it.</p>
    <h2>The dimension of affray</h2>
    <img src="Assets/The dimension of affray.png" alt="The dimension full of fury">
    <p>This is a dimension very little people know of. It's filled of hate, fury, destruction, affray, and so much more. If you ever find yourself in this dimension with another being, pray that you know how to fight better than your enemy. For that is the only way to get out.</p>
    <h3>The temple of Strength</h3>
    <img src="Assets/The temple of Strength.png" alt="The temple of strength">
    <p>The temple of strength was first found by the strongest man of the land. While it says the temple of strenght, it's more than just physical power. This is why if you want to up your level this is where you go.</p>
    <h4>Shirohi's House</h4>
    <img src="Assets/Shirohi's House.png" alt="Shirohi's House">
    <p>This is where a fiery hero lives. It's not too big, not too small, but just the right size for a cozy individual. You can usually find him in the forest or walking around Everret Road.</p>
